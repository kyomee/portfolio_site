Most brand teams are using AI the wrong way.

They're using it to produce more content — more posts, more copy variations, more campaign briefs. And they're getting exactly what that approach delivers: higher volume, lower signal, and a brand voice that sounds like everyone else's.

The brands doing this well aren't using AI to produce more. They're using it to think more clearly — to find the signal in their narrative, stress-test their positioning, and scale what's already working.

This post is a practical framework for that approach, with real brand cases that show what it looks like in practice.

## The Problem AI Doesn't Solve (And the One It Does)

Brand narrative is a strategic problem before it's an execution problem. AI tools are exceptionally good at execution. They are not good at strategy — they will confidently generate a brand voice document, a positioning statement, and a manifesto for a brand that has no clear reason to exist, and none of it will be wrong in ways you can easily detect.

So the question isn't "how do I get AI to write my brand story?" It's "how do I use AI to clarify what my brand story actually is, and then scale it without losing coherence?"

That's a different problem. And it has a more useful answer.

## Stage 1: Discover — Use AI to Find What You Actually Stand For

The first failure mode in brand narrative work is building on an untested assumption about what the brand means to the people it's trying to reach.

AI tools give you a faster path to testing those assumptions.

### Synthesise audience language at scale

Tools like **Perplexity**, **ChatGPT**, and **Claude** can synthesise large volumes of customer reviews, Reddit threads, social comments, and forum posts into structured insight about how audiences actually describe a problem, a product, or a category.

This matters because the gap between how a brand describes itself and how customers describe it is usually where the narrative problem lives.

**Practical approach**: Feed AI the raw language your customers use (from reviews, support tickets, social conversations) and ask it to identify the words and framings they reach for — not the words in your brand guidelines. Compare. The gaps are your brief.

### Stress-test your positioning

**Heinz** demonstrated something important with its "Draw Ketchup" campaign: when they asked people — and then AI image generators — to draw ketchup, they consistently drew Heinz. That's category ownership. Not every brand has it, and AI tools can help you quickly determine whether yours does.

Feed your positioning statement to an LLM and ask it to argue against it. Ask it to generate competitor positioning statements that could undermine yours. Ask it to identify the assumptions your narrative relies on that a skeptical customer might reject. This stress-testing is faster and cheaper than traditional qualitative research — and often more honest.

## Stage 2: Build — Generate, Test, and Refine Narrative Elements

Once you have strategic clarity, AI tools become genuinely powerful for building the components of a brand narrative.

### Brand voice development

The best use of LLMs in brand building is iterative voice development. Start with a rough brief about who you are and who you're talking to, then use AI to generate variations — and use those variations to sharpen your judgment about what's right and what isn't.

**Spotify** built one of the most distinctive brand voices in tech — irreverent, self-aware, data-intimate — and the AI-driven "Wrapped" campaign scales that voice to millions of personalised moments each year. The voice itself wasn't built by AI, but AI allows it to be expressed at a scale no human team could manage. The lesson: invest in defining the voice first, then let AI execute within it.

### Visual narrative at concept stage

**Coca-Cola's** "Create Real Magic" platform (built with OpenAI) invited consumers and creators to generate art using Coca-Cola's visual archive — its iconography, its brand assets — as source material. The campaign generated over 120,000 pieces of AI art. More importantly, it demonstrated that Coca-Cola's visual identity is so deeply established that AI tools could reliably reproduce and extend it. The brand narrative survived — and was reinforced by — generative AI.

For most brands, the lesson is earlier-stage: use tools like **Midjourney** or **DALL-E** to generate concept art for campaigns before committing to production. This compresses the ideation-to-validation cycle significantly and lets you stress-test visual directions without cost.

### Narrative consistency checks

One of the underused applications of AI in brand work is consistency auditing. Feed a year's worth of brand copy into an LLM and ask it to identify where the voice drifts, where the claims contradict each other, and where the brand sounds like something it says it isn't.

**Nike** faces this challenge at massive scale — brand communications across hundreds of markets, multiple product lines, and dozens of cultural contexts. AI-assisted consistency auditing doesn't replace editorial judgment, but it flags problems at a speed human review can't match.

## Stage 3: Scale — Maintain Coherence Across Touchpoints

The hardest part of brand narrative work isn't building the story. It's keeping it coherent as the brand scales — more markets, more channels, more people speaking on behalf of the brand.

### Personalisation without fragmentation

**Starbucks** uses its Deep Brew AI platform to power personalised recommendations across its loyalty programme. From a brand perspective, the challenge is that personalisation can fragment brand experience — every customer gets something different, and the cumulative effect is a brand that means different things to different people.

Starbucks solves this by keeping the personalisation at the product and offer level, while the brand narrative — warmth, belonging, the "third place" — stays consistent. AI handles the variation in the transaction. Brand strategy handles the consistency in the meaning.

This is the model: AI scales the execution, brand strategy constrains the variables.

### Real-time narrative monitoring

Tools like **Brandwatch** and **Sprinklr** use AI to monitor brand sentiment and narrative at scale — tracking not just mentions, but the emotional register and the narrative frame in which the brand is appearing. This matters because brand narrative isn't just what you say; it's what's being said about you, and the two are always in tension.

**L'Oréal** uses AI sentiment analysis across global markets to detect early signals of narrative drift — moments when the brand is being associated with frames it doesn't want to own. Early detection lets brand teams respond before a minor misalignment becomes a positioning problem.

## The Framework: AI Across the Brand Narrative Stack

| Stage | Strategic question | AI tool application |
|---|---|---|
| **Discover** | What do we actually mean to our audience? | Audience language synthesis, positioning stress-tests |
| **Build** | How do we express that clearly? | Voice development, visual concept generation, consistency audits |
| **Scale** | How do we stay coherent as we grow? | Personalisation with guardrails, real-time narrative monitoring |

The pattern across every case above is the same: AI accelerates execution within a strategic frame. The brands that use it well have done the strategic work first. The brands that get into trouble with AI are the ones that use it to avoid doing that work.

## What AI Still Can't Do

AI cannot tell you what your brand should stand for. It cannot make the judgment calls about which market to prioritise, which customer to speak to, or what trade-off to make when your core message doesn't resonate in a new context.

It cannot replace the human intelligence required to look at a brand and say: this is coherent, this is true, this is worth building.

What it can do — when used deliberately — is give you more time and capacity to do that thinking, by handling the execution that used to consume it.

That's the deal. It's a good one, if you hold up your end.
